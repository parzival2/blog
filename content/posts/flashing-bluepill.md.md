I want to get into programming [Blue-pill](https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill.html) using [libopencm3](https://libopencm3.org/) and [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/). To get started I wanted to compile few test programs to really get the feel for it. I needed a flasher as the small board doesnt have an inbuilt programmer like [STM32F4Discovery](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html)
## ST-Link
